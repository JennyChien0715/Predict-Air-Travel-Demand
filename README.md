Business Problem: The airline industry has the lowest profit margins and a black swan event like the coronavirus pandemic can be catastrophic to the financial health of the company. 
The airlines will have to decide on which routes to focus the most on, to limit losses. 

Use Scenario: Given a certain set of details like route, origin, destination, and the COVID rates in those regions, we can predict the demand (number of passengers). Airline companies can use this prediction to manage operations.
